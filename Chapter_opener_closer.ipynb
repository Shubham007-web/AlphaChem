      "      - How has the periodic table evolved into a powerful tool for understanding elements and their properties?\n",
      "- How do we use the periodic table to predict the properties of elements?\n",
      "- How can we predict the reactivity and properties of elements based on their positions on the periodic table?\n",
      "    - These questions encourage critical thinking and are connected to the unit’s overarching phenomenon: \"In northern countries, where winter brings extremely cold weather, streets and roads are often covered in ice and snow. This creates hazardous conditions for both pedestrians and drivers. Pedestrians can slip and fall, risking injury, while cars may skid on the icy surfaces, potentially causing accidents. To reduce these dangers, road salt is spread on icy streets to help melt the ice and snow. As the salt comes into contact with the ice, ice and snow seem to vanish. Metal street signs and lampposts are also exposed to the same ice and snow, but they do not vanish..\"\n",
