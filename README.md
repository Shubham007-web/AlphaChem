# AI-Powered Chemistry Lesson Content Generator

## Overview

This project is a Python-based system designed to generate structured chemistry lesson content for students in grades 9-10 (age 14-15). The system uses OpenAI's GPT models to produce easy-to-read educational content aligned with modern instructional strategies such as SMART objectives and phenomenon-based learning. The generated content is saved in `.docx` format, following a well-organized folder structure.

## Key Features

- **Two-Part Content Generation**: Divides content creation into two parts:
  - **Part 1**: Focuses on the structure and an extended "Explain" section (up to 3000 words).
  - **Part 2**: Covers the remaining lesson sections (Engage, Evaluate, Elaborate).
- **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: Ensures detailed, logical explanations that are appropriate for high school students.
- **Automated Document Organization**: Generated lessons are saved with automatic folder structure and version control (`V1`, `V2`, etc.).
- **Flesch Reading Ease Score**: Ensures content has a reading ease score above 90, making it suitable for a target audience of U.S. grade 9 students.

## File and Folder Structure

The system organizes the generated content into a structured folder hierarchy:
