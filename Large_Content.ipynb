To reduce these dangers, road salt is spread on icy streets to help melt the ice and snow. As the salt comes into contact with the ice, ice and snow seem to vanish.

      "\n",
      "Atoms are made up of three types of subatomic particles: **protons**, **neutrons**, and **electrons**. These tiny particles are responsible for the identity and behavior of atoms. Let’s break down their roles:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Protons** have a positive charge (+) and are found in the atom’s nucleus (the center of the atom). The number of protons an atom has determines what element it is. For example, an atom with 1 proton is hydrogen, while an atom with 6 protons is carbon.\n",
      "- **Neutrons** are neutral, meaning they have no charge. They are also found in the nucleus along with protons. The number of neutrons can change even within the same element – atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons are called **isotopes**.\n",
      "- **Electrons** have a negative charge (−) and move around the nucleus in regions called electron clouds. Electrons are much smaller than protons and neutrons, and they don’t contribute much to the atom’s mass.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Atomic Number and Mass Number**  \n",
      "The **atomic number** of an atom is the number of protons in its nucleus. This is a key characteristic because it defines the element. For example, every atom of carbon has 6 protons, so carbon’s atomic number is 6. The atomic number is often written above the element symbol on the periodic table.\n",
      "\n",
      "The **mass number** is the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Protons and neutrons each have a mass of about 1 atomic mass unit (**amu**). Electrons have almost no mass, so they are not included in the mass number.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Example**:  \n",
      "Let’s look at oxygen. Oxygen has an atomic number of 8, which means it has 8 protons. If an oxygen atom also has 8 neutrons, its mass number is:  \n",
      "\\[\n",

This balance of positive and negative charges means the atom overall has no charge. However, if an atom gains or loses electrons, it becomes an **ion**, which has either a positive or negative charge.\n",

For most elements, the atomic mass is close to the mass number of the most common isotope, but it is not always a whole number. On the periodic table, you’ll see the atomic mass listed below the element symbol.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example**:  \n",
      "Chlorine has two common isotopes: Cl-35 and Cl-37. The atomic mass of chlorine is 35.45 amu, because there are more Cl-35 atoms than Cl-37 atoms in nature, making Cl-35 more common.\n",

Now that you know the basics of atomic structure, you are ready to dive deeper into how atoms bond together to form the compounds we see in everyday life, like the salt used to melt icy roads.\n",
