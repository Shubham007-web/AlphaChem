      "- **How do covalent bonds form, and how do they differ from ionic bonds?**\n",
      "  - Covalent bonds form when two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons to achieve stability. This is different from ionic bonds, where atoms transfer electrons. In covalent bonding, atoms are held together by shared electrons between them, while in ionic bonding, oppositely charged ions are attracted to each other.\n",

To reduce these dangers, road salt is spread on icy streets to help melt the ice and snow. As the salt comes into contact with the ice, ice and snow seem to vanish. However, metal street signs and lampposts do not vanish under the same conditions.\n",

But does the molecular structure of water change? Is there a way to predict the shapes of molecules? We know that water dissolves salt, but why does it behave this way, and why don't all substances dissolve in water?\n",

      "### 9. Explain (Lightbulb):\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let's dive deeper into covalent bonds and their properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 9.1 Formation of Covalent Bonds:\n",
      "Covalent bonds form when **atoms share electrons** to achieve a full outer electron shell, also known as a **stable electron configuration**. This is commonly seen in nonmetals. For example, in a **hydrogen molecule (H₂)**, each hydrogen atom has one electron. By sharing their electrons, they each achieve the electron configuration of helium, which is more stable.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Single Bond:** \n",
      "  - A **single bond** occurs when atoms share one pair of electrons. For example, in **H₂**, each hydrogen atom shares one electron with the other hydrogen atom, forming a single bond.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Double Bond:**\n",
      "  - A **double bond** happens when atoms share two pairs of electrons. A common example is **oxygen (O₂)**, where each oxygen atom shares two pairs of electrons with the other, creating a double bond.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Triple Bond:**\n",
      "  - A **triple bond** is formed when atoms share three pairs of electrons. **Nitrogen (N₂)** is an example of a molecule with a triple bond, where each nitrogen atom shares three pairs of electrons with the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sample Problem:**\n",
      "**Question:** How many pairs of electrons are shared in a molecule of O₂?  \n",
      "**Answer:** In O₂, two pairs of electrons are shared between the oxygen atoms, forming a double bond.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Progress Check:**\n",
      "**Question:** How many pairs of electrons are shared in a molecule of N₂?\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 9.2 Properties of Covalent Compounds:\n",
      "Covalent compounds have different properties compared to ionic compounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Low Melting and Boiling Points:**  \n",
      "  Covalent compounds like **water (H₂O)** and **methane (CH₄)** have lower melting and boiling points compared to ionic compounds like **sodium chloride (NaCl)**. This is because the forces between molecules in covalent compounds are weaker than the forces between ions in ionic compounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Poor Conductors of Electricity:**  \n",
      "  Covalent compounds generally do not conduct electricity because they do not have charged particles (ions). For example, water (H₂O) and sugar (C₆H₁₂O₆) do not conduct electricity in their solid or liquid forms.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Solubility:**  \n",
      "  While some covalent compounds dissolve in water (like sugar), many do not (like oil). This depends on whether the covalent compound can interact with water molecules.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sample Problem:**\n",
      "**Question:** Why does NaCl conduct electricity when dissolved in water, but sugar (C₆H₁₂O₆) does not?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer:** NaCl is an ionic compound and breaks apart into ions when dissolved in water, which allows it to conduct electricity. Sugar, on the other hand, is a covalent compound and does not break into ions, so it does not conduct electricity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Progress Check:**\n",
      "**Question:** Why do covalent compounds generally have low melting points compared to ionic compounds?\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 9.3 Constructing Lewis Structures:\n",
      "**Lewis structures** are diagrams that represent the bonding between atoms in a molecule and the lone pairs of electrons that may exist. To draw a Lewis structure, follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Determine the total number of valence electrons** in the molecule.\n",
      "2. **Arrange the atoms** with the least electronegative atom in the center (except for hydrogen, which is always on the outside).\n",
      "3. **Pair electrons** to form covalent bonds.\n",
      "4. **Distribute remaining electrons** as lone pairs around the atoms to complete the octet rule (for most atoms, except hydrogen, which requires only 2 electrons).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example: Water (H₂O)**\n",
      "- Total valence electrons: 8 (2 from hydrogen, 6 from oxygen)\n",
      "- The oxygen atom is in the center, with two hydrogen atoms attached by single bonds.\n",
      "- Two lone pairs of electrons remain on the oxygen atom.\n",

      "#### Question 1 (DOK 1 - Recall):  \n",
      "**What is the chemical formula for water?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer:**  \n",
      "The chemical formula for water is **H₂O**. This means each water molecule has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Question 2 (DOK 2 - Skill/Concept):  \n",
      "**Explain why water is a polar molecule.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer:**  \n",
      "Water is a polar molecule because the oxygen atom is more electronegative than the hydrogen atoms. This creates a difference in charge between the oxygen (slightly negative) and the hydrogen (slightly positive). The unequal sharing of electrons gives water its polarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Question 3 (DOK 3 - Strategic Thinking):  \n",
      "**How does the polarity of water contribute to its ability to dissolve many substances?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer:**  \n",
      "The polarity of water allows it to dissolve many substances because the positive and negative ends of the water molecules can surround and interact with the positive and negative parts of other molecules. For example, when salt (NaCl) dissolves in water, the water molecules surround the Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions, separating them and dissolving the salt.\n",

      "#### Task 1 (DOK 2 - Conceptual Understanding):  \n",
      "**Draw a diagram of a water molecule. Label the hydrogen and oxygen atoms and indicate areas of positive and negative charge.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer:**  \n",
      "Students should draw a V-shaped water molecule, with the oxygen atom (O) at the center and the hydrogen atoms (H) attached to it at an angle. The oxygen side should be labeled as slightly negative (δ-) and the hydrogen sides as slightly positive (δ+).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Task 2 (DOK 3 - Strategic Thinking):  \n",
      "**How would the properties of water change if it were a non-polar molecule?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer:**  \n",
      "If water were a non-polar molecule, it would not have the same ability to dissolve many substances, especially ionic compounds like salts. Water’s high boiling point and surface tension would also decrease, as these properties rely on the strong intermolecular forces (hydrogen bonds) formed by its polarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Task 3 (DOK 3 - Extended Thinking):  \n",
      "**Design a simple experiment to test the solubility of different substances (e.g., salt, sugar, oil) in water.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer:**  \n",
      "Students could take three small containers of water and dissolve salt in the first, sugar in the second, and oil in the third. They would observe which substances dissolve and which do not. The salt and sugar would dissolve because they are polar, while the oil would not because it is non-polar.\n",

      "\n",
      "**1. What is the main reason water is a polar molecule?**  \n",
      "a) The hydrogen atoms are larger than the oxygen atom.  \n",
      "b) Oxygen shares electrons equally with hydrogen.  \n",
      "c) Oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen.  \n",
      "d) Water molecules are round.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer:**  \n",
      "c) **Oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen.**  \n",
      "*Explanation:* The oxygen atom pulls electrons closer to itself, creating a negative charge around the oxygen and a positive charge around the hydrogen atoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Which of the following substances is most likely to dissolve in water?**  \n",
      "a) Oil  \n",

      "**Answer:**  \n",
      "b) **Sodium chloride (NaCl)**  \n",
      "*Explanation:* Sodium chloride is an ionic compound, and water can dissolve it due to its polarity.\n",

      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Long-Answer Questions (DOK 3-4)\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Explain how water’s high specific heat helps regulate Earth's climate.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer:**  \n",
      "Water’s high specific heat means it can absorb a lot of heat without a significant increase in temperature. This property helps regulate the Earth's climate by moderating temperature swings. Oceans, lakes, and rivers absorb heat during the day and release heat slowly at night, keeping temperatures within a narrower range.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Describe how hydrogen bonds affect the properties of water.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer:**  \n",
      "Hydrogen bonds are responsible for many of water’s unique properties. They give water a high boiling point because it takes more energy to break the bonds between molecules. Hydrogen bonds also create surface tension, allowing small insects to walk on water, and cause water to expand when it freezes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. How does the structure of a water molecule contribute to its role as a \"universal solvent\"?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer:**  \n",
      "Water’s polarity allows it to dissolve many substances, especially ionic and other polar compounds. The slightly positive hydrogen atoms attract negative ions, while the slightly negative oxygen atom attracts positive ions. This helps break apart compounds and dissolve them in water.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. If Earth had no water, how would life be different?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer:**  \n",
      "Without water, life as we know it would not exist. Water is essential for biochemical reactions, transporting nutrients, and regulating temperature in living organisms. Most life forms rely on the solvent properties of water to carry nutrients, remove waste, and maintain homeostasis. Earth’s climate would also likely be more extreme due to the lack of water’s temperature-regulating effects.\n",
