      "### 9. Explain (Lightbulb):\n",
      "The development of the periodic table involved many scientists and spanned several decades. Here’s a breakdown of how it happened and why it’s important.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **1. Mendeleev’s Contribution:**\n",
      "In 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev, a Russian chemist, was trying to organize the known elements in a way that made sense. At the time, about 63 elements were known, and their properties were often puzzling. Mendeleev arranged the elements by increasing **atomic mass**. He noticed that elements with similar properties appeared at regular intervals, and this led him to create the first version of the periodic table.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Mendeleev’s table had some gaps, but he was bold enough to predict that these gaps represented elements that hadn’t been discovered yet. When these elements were later found, they fit perfectly into Mendeleev’s table, proving that his system worked well — for the most part.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there were some issues. A few elements didn’t seem to fit properly when ordered by atomic mass. For example, iodine and tellurium appeared to be in the wrong order based on their masses, but their properties suggested they were in the right place.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sample Problem**:  \n",
      "Suppose we arrange the elements lithium (Li), beryllium (Be), and boron (B) based on atomic mass. Predict the element that would come next based on Mendeleev’s arrangement.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Progress Check**:  \n",
      "Given the following elements arranged by atomic mass: lithium (Li), potassium (K), and rubidium (Rb), predict which element might come next.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **2. Moseley’s Contribution:**\n",
      "In 1913, Henry Moseley, an English physicist, discovered that the periodic table should be arranged according to **atomic number**, not atomic mass. Moseley used X-ray experiments to show that each element has a unique number of protons in its nucleus. This number, called the **atomic number**, is a more accurate way to organize the elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the elements were arranged by atomic number, the inconsistencies in Mendeleev’s table disappeared. Elements that seemed out of order based on mass, like iodine and tellurium, were now in the correct positions when ordered by atomic number.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sample Problem**:  \n",
      "Explain why iodine (atomic number 53) and tellurium (atomic number 52) were placed in the wrong order when arranged by atomic mass but are correctly ordered by atomic number.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Progress Check**:  \n",
      "Given the atomic numbers of sulfur (16) and chlorine (17), predict which element comes next in the periodic table when arranged by atomic number.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **3. The Modern Periodic Table:**\n",
      "Today, the periodic table is arranged by atomic number, which reflects the number of protons in an atom’s nucleus. The elements are arranged in rows called **periods** and columns called **groups**. Elements in the same group have similar chemical properties because they have the same number of electrons in their outer shell.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), and calcium (Ca) are all in different groups. This explains why the salts they form behave differently. Sodium is in Group 1, magnesium is in Group 2, and calcium is also in Group 2 but lower down. These differences in group position explain why magnesium chloride and calcium chloride are more effective at melting ice than sodium chloride.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 10. Elaborate (Extend):\n",
      "**Extension Activity**:  \n",

      "### 10. Evaluate (Progress Check) - Explain\n",
      "\n",
      "In this section, we'll pose three scaffolded questions to confirm your understanding of key concepts. These questions will follow varying levels of Depth of Knowledge (DOK), helping you to deepen your learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Question 1 (DOK 1 - Recall):\n",
      "**What is the chemical symbol for water, and what elements make up this compound?**\n",
      "- **Answer**: The chemical symbol for water is **H₂O**. It is made up of **two hydrogen atoms** and **one oxygen atom**.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Question 2 (DOK 2 - Skill/Concept):\n",
      "**Explain why water is considered a polar molecule.**\n",
      "- **Answer**: Water is a polar molecule because **oxygen** has a higher electronegativity than hydrogen. This means oxygen pulls the electrons in the bond closer to itself, creating a partial negative charge on the oxygen atom and a partial positive charge on the hydrogen atoms. This uneven distribution of charge makes water polar.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Question 3 (DOK 3 - Strategic Thinking):\n",
      "**How does the polarity of water contribute to its ability to dissolve many substances?**\n",
      "- **Answer**: Water's polarity allows it to interact with and surround charged or polar molecules. The partially negative oxygen side of water can attract positive ions, while the partially positive hydrogen side can attract negative ions or other polar molecules. This helps to break apart substances, making water an excellent solvent.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 11. Elaborate (Power Up)\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's dive deeper into the concepts to expand your thinking!\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Mini-task 1:\n",
      "**Compare and contrast the solubility of polar and nonpolar substances in water. What can you infer about how substances mix based on their polarity?**\n",
      "- **Answer**: Polar substances, like salt (NaCl), dissolve well in water because water is polar and can surround and separate the charged ions. Nonpolar substances, like oil, do not dissolve in water because there is no attraction between the nonpolar molecules and the polar water molecules. This is why oil and water don’t mix.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Mini-task 2:\n",
      "**Water has a high specific heat capacity. How does this property affect the environment, particularly in coastal regions?**\n",
      "- **Answer**: Water’s high specific heat capacity means it can absorb or release large amounts of heat without changing its temperature drastically. Coastal regions experience milder climates because the nearby ocean absorbs heat in the summer and releases it in the winter, moderating the temperatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Mini-task 3:\n",
      "**Design an experiment to test how temperature affects the solubility of sugar in water. What would be your hypothesis and method?**\n",
      "- **Answer**: **Hypothesis**: The solubility of sugar increases as the water temperature rises. **Method**: Heat water to different temperatures (e.g., 10°C, 30°C, 50°C, 70°C, and 90°C) and measure how much sugar can dissolve in each sample. Record the amount of sugar dissolved at each temperature.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 12. Final Evaluation\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Debate Question:\n",
      "**Should the use of chemical solvents in industry be reduced in favor of “greener” solvents like water?**\n",
      "- **Arguments For**: Water is non-toxic, readily available, and environmentally friendly. Using water as a solvent reduces harmful chemical waste and pollution.\n",
      "- **Arguments Against**: Water cannot dissolve all substances, especially nonpolar compounds like oils. Chemical solvents are sometimes necessary for manufacturing processes that water cannot achieve.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Multiple-Choice Questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Which of the following best explains why water is a good solvent?**\n",
      "   - a) Water is a gas at room temperature.\n",
      "   - b) Water has a high boiling point.\n",
      "   - c) Water is a polar molecule.\n",
      "   - d) Water has a low density.\n",
      "   - **Answer**: c) Water is a polar molecule.  \n",
      "     **Explanation**: Water's polarity allows it to dissolve many substances, especially ionic and polar compounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **What happens to water’s boiling point when salt is added?**\n",
      "   - a) It increases.\n",
      "   - b) It decreases.\n",
      "   - c) It stays the same.\n",
      "   - d) It boils instantly.\n",
      "   - **Answer**: a) It increases.  \n",
      "     **Explanation**: Salt increases the boiling point because the dissolved ions interfere with water molecules escaping into gas form.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Which term describes a substance that does not dissolve in water?**\n",
      "   - a) Solvent\n",
      "   - b) Polar\n",
      "   - c) Insoluble\n",
      "   - d) Soluble\n",
      "   - **Answer**: c) Insoluble.  \n",
      "     **Explanation**: Insoluble substances cannot dissolve in a solvent like water.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Why is water considered a polar molecule?**\n",
      "   - a) It has equal sharing of electrons between hydrogen and oxygen.\n",
      "   - b) It has an uneven distribution of charges across the molecule.\n",
      "   - c) It has a neutral pH.\n",
      "   - d) It is always a liquid at room temperature.\n",
      "   - **Answer**: b) It has an uneven distribution of charges across the molecule.  \n",
      "     **Explanation**: The oxygen atom is partially negative and the hydrogen atoms are partially positive, making water polar.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Long-Answer Questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Explain how hydrogen bonding contributes to water’s unique properties, such as its high boiling point and surface tension.**\n",
      "   - **Answer**: Hydrogen bonds form between the partially positive hydrogen atoms of one water molecule and the partially negative oxygen atoms of another. These bonds are strong enough to keep water molecules close together, which contributes to water’s high boiling point. They also cause high surface tension, as the water molecules at the surface are pulled together more strongly.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Describe why ice floats on water, and explain the importance of this property to aquatic life.**\n",
      "   - **Answer**: Ice floats because it is less dense than liquid water. As water freezes, its molecules form a crystalline structure that takes up more space, making ice less dense. This property is crucial for aquatic life because it insulates the water below, allowing organisms to survive in cold temperatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **How does water’s high heat capacity affect the climate of coastal areas?**\n",
      "   - **Answer**: Water’s high heat capacity allows it to absorb and release large amounts of heat without significant temperature changes. This moderates the climate in coastal areas, leading to cooler summers and warmer winters compared to inland regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Compare the solubility of table salt (NaCl) in water to that of oil. Discuss why you observe these differences.**\n",
      "   - **Answer**: Table salt (NaCl) is highly soluble in water because it is an ionic compound, and water can surround and dissolve the charged ions. Oil, being nonpolar, does not dissolve in water because there are no attractions between the nonpolar oil molecules and the polar water molecules.\n",

      "### 13. Extend (Beyond the Lesson)\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Additional Tasks and Readings:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Task**: Research and write a short essay on how water is used as a solvent in the pharmaceutical industry. How does water’s polarity benefit this field?\n",
      "2. **Reading**: Explore articles on \"The Role of Water in Climate Regulation\" and summarize how water's properties help maintain the Earth's temperature.\n",
      "3. **Challenge**: Investigate alternative solvents that are environmentally friendly. Compare their effectiveness to water in dissolving substances.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Spaced Practice:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Activity**: Over the next week, revisit the concept of solubility by experimenting with different household substances (sugar, salt, oil, vinegar). Record the solubility of each in water and other liquids like alcohol or vinegar.\n",
      "- **Question**: How might the solubility of these substances change if the temperature or pressure is altered?\n",
