Pedestrians can slip and fall, risking injury, while cars may skid on the icy surfaces, potentially causing accidents. To reduce these dangers, road salt is spread on icy streets to help melt the ice and snow. As the salt comes into contact with the ice, ice and snow seem to vanish. Metal street signs and lampposts are also exposed to the same ice and snow, but they do not vanish.\n",

Let’s start with the very basic structure of all substances, the atom. Salt, water, metals, and all matter are made of atoms. Are all atoms alike? Kind of …. In some ways they are, in some other ways they are not. In this chapter, you will discover what atoms are and how atoms of different elements have different structured. You will learn that water is made of hydrogen and oxygen atoms, and that the atoms of those two elements are different. But then again, are all hydrogen atoms identical? Are all oxygen atoms identical? What are isotopes? When are they stable or radioactive? How does tracking isotopes help scientists keep the roads safe and manage water and land resources?\n",

Protons have a positive charge, electrons have a negative charge, and neutrons have no charge. The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is called its atomic number, which defines the type of element. The total number of protons and neutrons in an atom’s nucleus is called the mass number.\n",

      "\n",
      "At the core of every atom is its **nucleus**, which contains **protons** and **neutrons**. Surrounding the nucleus are **electrons**, orbiting at various distances. Let’s break down the key components:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1. **Protons, Neutrons, and Electrons**:\n",
      "- **Protons** are positively charged particles. Each element has a unique number of protons, which is its **atomic number**. For example, hydrogen has 1 proton, and oxygen has 8 protons.\n",
      "- **Neutrons** have no charge and add mass to the atom. Neutrons, together with protons, contribute to the atom’s **mass number**.\n",
      "- **Electrons** are negatively charged and orbit the nucleus. In a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. **Atomic Number**:\n",
      "The atomic number tells us how many protons are in the atom. It also helps us determine the element. For example, every atom with 6 protons is carbon, and every atom with 8 protons is oxygen. The atomic number defines the identity of the atom.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. **Mass Number and Atomic Mass**:\n",
      "The **mass number** is the total number of protons and neutrons in an atom. For example, an oxygen atom with 8 protons and 8 neutrons has a mass number of 16. The **atomic mass**, usually given in units of **atomic mass units (amu)**, is slightly different because it takes into account the tiny mass of electrons and isotopes (atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons).\n",

      "**Solution**:  \n",

      "Isotopes are atoms of the same element that have different numbers of neutrons. For example, carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, but carbon-14 has 6 protons and 8 neutrons. Even though they are both carbon, they have different mass numbers.\n",
