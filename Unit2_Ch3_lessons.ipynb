      "**Background Information:**\n",
      "- **John Dalton (1803)**: Dalton proposed that atoms were indivisible spheres. He suggested that each element consisted of its own unique type of atom.\n",
      "- **J.J. Thomson (1897)**: Discovered the electron and proposed the \"plum pudding\" model, where electrons were embedded in a positively charged sphere.\n",
      "- **Ernest Rutherford (1911)**: Conducted the gold foil experiment and proposed that atoms have a small, dense nucleus surrounded by electrons.\n",
      "- **Niels Bohr (1913)**: Suggested that electrons orbit the nucleus in fixed paths or energy levels.\n",
      "- **Modern Quantum Model**: Electrons occupy regions of space called electron clouds, and their exact position cannot be determined.\n",
