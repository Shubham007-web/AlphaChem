    "Car accidents are a major cause of injuries and fatalities worldwide. Road safety is a critical concern implemented by governments to reduce accidents. Cars manufacturers also aim at reducing risks by including two major safety features: seat belts and airbags. Front airbags reduce driver fatalities in frontal crashes by 29% and fatalities of front-seat passengers aged 13 and older by 32% ; side airbags that protect the head reduce a car driver’s risk of death in driver-side crashes by 37% and an SUV driver’s risk by 52%. Overall, airbags can reduce passenger injuries by 50% in a car accident. In the event of a car crash, sensors trigger the airbags to deploy rapidly to cushion and protect passengers. The cushion is provided by gas that is rapidly released from a chemical reaction inside the airbag. The airbag inflates due to the gas from the chemical reaction. But the products of the chemical reaction should also be safe for passengers. For example, excess sodium metal can react violently with moisture in the air. \"\n",

Or maybe you've seen a crystal that looks shiny because it seems to \"hold onto water.\" These are examples of hydrates! Hydrates are compounds that have water molecules chemically attached to them. But don’t confuse them with wet substances like a soaked sponge—hydrates have water as part of their chemical structure. These water molecules are trapped inside the substance in a specific ratio.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, imagine a salt crystal that has water molecules locked inside. In its formula, water isn’t just floating around—it’s written as part of the compound! A good example of this is copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate, with the formula **CuSO₄·5H₂O**. That \"·5H₂O\" tells us the compound contains five water molecules for every formula unit of copper(II) sulfate.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **If a molecule has a strong bond, what does that tell us about its stability and energy?**\n",
      "   - Strong bonds mean the molecule is more stable and less reactive. Breaking such bonds would require significant energy.\n",

      "3. **Imagine breaking a chemical bond in a molecule. What forms of energy might be involved?**\n",
      "   - Energy required to break bonds is often supplied in the form of heat or light. This energy is called the bond dissociation energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **How can we predict whether a reaction will produce heat or absorb heat?**\n",
      "   - By determining whether the reaction is exothermic (releases heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat). This can be done by comparing the energy of bonds broken and bonds formed.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Explain how the octet rule predicts the way atoms bond. Provide examples.**  \n",
      "   **Answer:** The octet rule suggests that atoms bond to complete their outer shells with eight electrons, achieving stability. For instance, in water (H₂O), oxygen shares electrons with two hydrogen atoms to fill its outer shell.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Describe the difference between exothermic and endothermic reactions and give examples of each.**  \n",
      "   **Answer:** Exothermic reactions release heat (e.g., combustion of wood), while endothermic reactions absorb heat (e.g., photosynthesis). Exothermic processes feel hot, and endothermic processes feel cold to the touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Why are molecules with strong chemical bonds more stable? Relate your answer to bond energy.**  \n",
      "   **Answer:** Strong chemical bonds require more energy to break, making the molecule less likely to react under typical conditions. For example, nitrogen gas (N₂) has a strong triple bond, which is why it’s so stable.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Predict what would happen if a chemical reaction breaks more bonds than it forms. Will it absorb or release energy? Why?**  \n",
      "   **Answer:** It will absorb energy because breaking bonds requires more energy than is released when new bonds are formed. This is characteristic of an endothermic process.\n",
