    "Car accidents are a major cause of injuries and fatalities worldwide. Road safety is a critical concern implemented by governments to reduce accidents. Cars manufacturers also aim at reducing risks by including two major safety features: seat belts and airbags. Front airbags reduce driver fatalities in frontal crashes by 29% and fatalities of front-seat passengers aged 13 and older by 32% ; side airbags that protect the head reduce a car driver’s risk of death in driver-side crashes by 37% and an SUV driver’s risk by 52%. Overall, airbags can reduce passenger injuries by 50% in a car accident. In the event of a car crash, sensors trigger the airbags to deploy rapidly to cushion and protect passengers. The cushion is provided by gas that is rapidly released from a chemical reaction inside the airbag. The airbag inflates due to the gas from the chemical reaction. But the products of the chemical reaction should also be safe for passengers. For example, excess sodium metal can react violently with moisture in the air. \n",

      "Have you ever left salt or sugar out in a humid room and noticed it clumping together? That’s because water in the air can stick to certain substances. Some compounds, like salts, can actually trap water molecules as part of their structure. These are called **hydrates**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hydrates are compounds that contain water molecules within their crystal structure. The water isn’t just sitting there—it’s chemically bonded to the compound. For example, Epsom salt, which you might use in a bath, is a hydrate. Its chemical formula is **MgSO₄·7H₂O**, meaning it contains magnesium sulfate and seven water molecules.\n",

      "But what happens when you heat a hydrate? The water can be removed, leaving behind an **anhydrous** (water-free) compound. This process is called **dehydration**.

      "One important property of hydrates is the **percent by mass of water**. This tells us how much of the hydrate's mass comes from water. To calculate it, follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step-by-Step Calculation\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Find the molar mass of the hydrate.** Add up the masses of all the atoms in the compound, including the water molecules.\n",
      "2. **Find the total mass of the water.** Multiply the number of water molecules by the molar mass of water (H₂O = 18.02 g/mol).\n",
      "3. **Divide the mass of water by the total molar mass of the hydrate.** Multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n",
