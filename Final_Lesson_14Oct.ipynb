      "\n",
      "This section will provide a detailed explanation of the main concepts of the lesson, using the unit and chapter phenomenon to illustrate how ions are formed and their significance in chemical bonding.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Formation of Ions**  \n",
      "Atoms are neutral when they have the same number of protons and electrons. However, when an atom gains or loses electrons, it no longer has the same number of these particles. This imbalance creates a charge, and the atom becomes an ion. There are two types of ions:  \n",
      "1. **Cations**: These are positively charged ions formed when an atom loses electrons. For example, sodium (Na) loses one electron to form Na⁺.  \n",
      "2. **Anions**: These are negatively charged ions formed when an atom gains electrons. For example, chlorine (Cl) gains one electron to form Cl⁻.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Octet Rule**  \n",
      "Atoms tend to gain, lose, or share electrons until they have eight electrons in their outer shell. This is known as the octet rule. For example:  \n",
      "- Sodium (Na) has one electron in its outer shell. It will lose this electron to achieve a full outer shell, becoming Na⁺.  \n",
      "- Chlorine (Cl) has seven electrons in its outer shell. It will gain one more electron to complete its octet, becoming Cl⁻.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Exceptions to the Octet Rule**  \n",
      "- Not all atoms follow the octet rule. Elements like hydrogen (H) and helium (He) only need two electrons to fill their outer shell. Transition metals, like iron (Fe), also don’t always follow the octet rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Ionic Bonds and the Role of Ions in Bonding**  \n",
      "When ions form, they can attract each other due to their opposite charges. For example, Na⁺ and Cl⁻ come together to form NaCl, or table salt. This attraction between oppositely charged ions is called an ionic bond. Ionic bonds are strong and form between metals and non-metals.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Predicting Ion Charges on the Periodic Table**  \n",
      "- **Group 1 elements**: These elements (like sodium) always form +1 cations by losing one electron.  \n",
      "- **Group 17 elements**: These elements (like chlorine) form -1 anions by gaining one electron.  \n",
      "- **Group 2 elements**: These elements (like magnesium) form +2 cations by losing two electrons.  \n",
      "- **Group 16 elements**: These elements (like oxygen) form -2 anions by gaining two electrons.\n",
