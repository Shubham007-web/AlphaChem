      "Imagine you’re a forensic chemist tasked with solving the mystery of a stolen bracelet. The police have returned what they believe is the original bracelet, but the owner insists it's a fake. How can you prove whether the bracelet is real or not? You’d need to use scientific inquiry to figure it out! \n",

      "\n",
      "**Experimental Design**: To test a hypothesis, you need to design an experiment. A good experiment includes the following components:\n",
      "- **Independent variable**: The factor you change in the experiment (e.g., the material of the bracelet).\n",
      "- **Dependent variable**: The factor you measure (e.g., the density of the material).\n",
      "- **Constants**: Factors that stay the same throughout the experiment (e.g., the method used to measure density).\n",

      "In this section, we’ll break down the scientific process and explain how experimental design helps answer important questions, like whether a bracelet is real gold or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1. **Scientific Inquiry**\n",
      "Scientific inquiry is the process of exploring the natural world and asking questions. The steps of scientific inquiry include:\n",
      "- **Asking a question**: For example, “Is the bracelet made of real gold?”\n",
      "- **Forming a hypothesis**: A hypothesis is a testable statement. In this case, your hypothesis might be, “If the bracelet is real gold, then its density will be close to 19.32 g/cm³.”\n",
      "- **Conducting an experiment**: You can test your hypothesis by measuring the density of the bracelet’s metal.\n",
      "- **Analyzing data**: After collecting your data, you can analyze it to see if the results support or refute your hypothesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. **Experimental Design**\n",
      "A good experimental design includes:\n",
      "- **Independent Variable**: This is the variable you change in the experiment. In our bracelet experiment, the independent variable is the type of metal being tested.\n",
      "- **Dependent Variable**: This is the variable you measure. In this case, the dependent variable is the density of the metal.\n",
      "- **Constants**: These are factors that stay the same throughout the experiment. For example, the method used to measure density should be the same for all metal samples.\n",
      "- **Control Group**: The control group is a baseline for comparison. In some experiments, you might need a control group, but in this case, we are directly comparing the density to the known value of pure gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. **Reliability and Validity**\n",
      "- **Reliability**: This refers to the consistency of your results. For example, if you measure the density of the same metal three times, you should get roughly the same result each time. If your results vary widely, your experiment may not be reliable.\n",
      "- **Validity**: This refers to whether your experiment measures what it’s supposed to measure. In this case, we want to measure the density of the metal, so our method must accurately measure both mass and volume.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4. **Bias and Error**\n",
      "Bias can occur in an experiment if the scientist has expectations about the outcome. For example, if you expect the bracelet to be fake, you might unconsciously interpret the data in a way that supports your expectation. To avoid bias, it’s important to replicate the experiment and have other scientists review your work.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example Problem**:\n",
      "A student measures the mass of a metal sample to be 38.6 grams and its volume to be 2 cm³. What is the density of the metal?  \n",
      "**Solution**:  \n",
      "\\[\n",
      "\\text{Density} = \\frac{\\text{Mass}}{\\text{Volume}} = \\frac{38.6}{2} = 19.3 \\, \\text{g/cm³}\n",
      "\\]  \n",
      "Since 19.3 g/cm³ is very close to the density of gold (19.32 g/cm³), the metal is likely to be gold.\n",

Some people argue that the density of the bracelet (19.3 g/cm³) is close enough to the density of gold (19.32 g/cm³) to claim that the bracelet is real.
