      "### Lightbulb (Explain):\n",
      "\n",
      "Ions are crucial in how substances interact with water and other elements. When atoms gain or lose electrons, they form ions, which are charged particles. The type of ion formed depends on the atom's electron configuration and its position on the periodic table.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Formation of Ions:\n",
      "- **Cations** form when an atom loses electrons. For example, sodium (Na) loses one electron to form Na⁺.\n",
      "- **Anions** form when an atom gains electrons. For example, chlorine (Cl) gains one electron to form Cl⁻.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ions are attracted to each other due to their opposite charges, resulting in an **ionic bond**. In the case of NaCl (table salt), sodium ions (Na⁺) and chloride ions (Cl⁻) form a crystal lattice, which dissolves easily in water.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Real-World Example:**\n",
      "When road salt (NaCl) is spread on icy roads, it dissolves in the water from the melting ice. The sodium and chloride ions interact with the water molecules, preventing the water from refreezing at higher temperatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Solved Example:\n",
      "**Question:** Predict the charge of a magnesium ion.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Solution:** Magnesium (Mg) has two electrons in its outer shell. It will lose these two electrons to follow the octet rule, forming a cation with a charge of 2⁺ (Mg²⁺).\n",

      "2. **DOK Level 2:** How does the Octet Rule help explain why sodium forms a positive ion and chlorine forms a negative ion?\n",
